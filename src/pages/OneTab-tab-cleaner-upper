![The top  tabs in  my OneTab](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7EbMfA7LS6s/WuTYcsh2P8I/AAAAAAAAwJc/BXUdrTI6NOwQR_F5uDrM2CkZVKl-YvsVQCLcBGAs/s1600/Screenshot%2B2018-04-28%2Bat%2B4.23.37%2BPM.png)



[OneTab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/onetab/chphlpgkkbolifaimnlloiipkdnihall) is a Chrome plugin that solves a problem that I have:  too many open tabs, which leads to both slow performance and distraction.



I get too many open tasks because I tend to leave a trail of open tabs behind me as I research, or task switch. I tell myself that I'll get around to handling them. But eventually I’ve got a unmanageable clutter. When I get too many tabs, I can use OneTab to close the tabs but not lose track of them.



OneTab keeps a local data structure that it renders as a web page. When I click on the plugin, it adds a new section and in it puts a links to each of the open tabs in  my current Chrome window. Then it closes those tabs. If I have a tab that I don't want closed, I can just drag it out of current window. 



My OneTab on this machine has too many files to count.  Every other machine that I use has its own OneTab  with its own many unhandled tabs.



Now it’s time to clean up some tabs.
